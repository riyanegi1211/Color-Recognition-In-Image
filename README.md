# Color-Recognition-In-Image

## About 
This project is a `python-based` application which detects the color from a live video feed. It uses `speech recognition` to speak out the name of the color along with displaying its name at the top left corner of the screen. Thus making it very useful for the visually impaired people to learn colors of the objects placed right on the pointer present on the screen. The application uses `HSV color model` for this purpose. It is a way of specifying colors similar to RGB (Red Green Blue) color approach but instead of specifying the amount of red, green and blue present in a color, it defines the color in terms of `Hue`, `Saturation` and `Value` or Lightness. Hue is the actual color like Orange, Blue, Green etc. Saturation is, how much pigmentation is there in the color while value is the brightness or lightness. It is how dark a color is. The reason why HSV is preferred over RGB is that, it is robust and stable towards any lightning changes or removing shadows. It separates luma or the image intensity from chrome or the color information. This application is capable of recognizing 256 colors accurately and quickly.
